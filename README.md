# mimosa

A project for Starkhack hackathon in 2024

## Setup

To get an instance of the frontend running on localhost, follow these steps:

```sh
# 1) run an instance of the starknet-devnet
yarn run devnet

# 2) compile and deploy the contracts to it
yarn run deploy

# 3) run the web server
yarn start
```

If all goes well, you can visit `localhost:3000` to interact with the contracts.
